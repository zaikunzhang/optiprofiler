function problem = matcutest_load(problem_name)
%MATCUTEST_LOAD coverts a problem in MatCUTEst to a Problem class instance.
%
%   Users only need to use the following signature to call this function:
%
%   PROBLEM = MATCUTEST_LOAD(PROBLEM_NAME) returns a Problem class instance
%   PROBLEM that corresponds to the problem named PROBLEM_NAME in MatCUTEst.
%
%   You may use the function `m_select` to get the problem names you want. More
%   details about MatCUTEst can be found in the official website:
%
%       https://github.com/matcutest
