benchmark
=========

**benchmark(**\ *varargin*\ **)**
    **benchmark** creates multiple profiles for benchmarking optimization solvers on a set of problems with different features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Signatures*:

**solver_scores** = **benchmark**\(**solvers**) creates performance profiles, data profiles, and log-ratio profiles for the given **solvers** on the default unconstrained problem set, returning **solver_scores** based on the profiles. **solvers** is a cell array of function handles. We require **solvers** to accept specified inputs and return specified outputs. Details can be found in the following *Cautions* part.

**solver_scores** = **benchmark**\(**solvers**, **feature_name**) creates profiles for the given **solvers** on the default unconstrained problem set with the specified feature **feature_name**.

**solver_scores** = **benchmark**\(**solvers**, **options**) creates profiles for the given **solvers** with options specified in the struct **options**. See *Options* part for more details.

**solver_scores** = **benchmark**\(**options**) creates profiles with options specified in the struct **options**. Note that the struct **options** should at least contain the field **load** with the value **\'latest\'** or a time stamp of an experiment in the format of 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss'. In this case, we will load the data from the specified experiment and draw the profiles.

[**solver_scores**, **profile_scores**] = **benchmark**\(...) returns a 4D tensor **profile_scores** containing scores for all profiles. See **score_fun** in *Options* part for more details.

[**solver_scores**, **profile_scores**, **curves**] = **benchmark**\(...) returns a cell array **curves** containing the curves of all the profiles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Cautions*:

1. Each **solver** in **solvers** should accept corresponding signature(s) depending on the test suite you choose:

- For an unconstrained problem:

  .. code-block:: matlab
  
    x = solver(fun, x0)
        
  where ``fun`` is a function handle of the objective function accepting a column vector and returning a real number, and ``x0`` is the initial guess which is a column vector;

- For a bound-constrained problem:

  .. code-block:: matlab
  
    x = solver(fun, x0, xl, xu)
        
  where ``xl`` and ``xu`` are the lower and upper bounds of the variables which are column vectors (they can contain Inf or -Inf);

- For a linearly constrained problem:

  .. code-block:: matlab
  
    x = solver(fun, x0, xl, xu, aub, bub, aeq, beq)
        
  where ``aub`` and ``aeq`` are the matrices of the linear inequality and equality constraints, and ``bub`` and ``beq`` are the vectors of the linear inequality and equality constraints;

- For a nonlinearly constrained problem:

  .. code-block:: matlab
  
    x = solver(fun, x0, xl, xu, aub, bub, aeq, beq, cub, ceq)
        
  where ``cub`` and ``ceq`` are the functions of the nonlinear inequality and equality constraints accepting a column vector and returning a column vector.

2. The log-ratio profiles are available only when there are exactly two solvers. For more information of performance and data profiles, see [1]_, [2]_, [5]_. For that of log-ratio profiles, see [4]_, [6]_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Options*:

Options should be specified in a struct. The following are the available fields of the struct:

1. *Options for profiles and plots*:

  - **n_jobs**: the number of parallel jobs to run the test. Default is the default number of workers in the default local cluster.

  - **seed**: the seed of the random number generator. Default is ``1``.

  - **benchmark_id**: the identifier of the test. It is used to create the specific directory to store the results. Default is ``'out'`` if the option ``load`` is not provided, otherwise default is ``'.'``.

  - **solver_names**: the names of the solvers. Default is the names of the function handles in **solvers**.

  - **solver_isrand**: whether the solvers are randomized or not. It is a logical array of the same length as the number of solvers, where the value is true if the solver is randomized, and false otherwise. Default is all false. Note that if ``n_runs`` is not specified, we will set it 5 for the randomized solvers.

  - **feature_stamp**: the stamp of the feature with the given options. It is used to create the specific directory to store the results. Default depends on features.

  - **errorbar_type**: the type of the uncertainty interval that can be either ``'minmax'`` or ``'meanstd'``. When ``n_runs`` is greater than 1, we run several times of the experiments and get average curves and get average curves and uncertainty intervals. Default is ``'minmax'``, meaning that we takes the pointwise minimum and maximum of the curves.

  - **savepath**: the path to store the results. Default is ``'pwd'``, the current working directory.

  - **max_tol_order**: the maximum order of the tolerance. In any profile (performance profiles, data profiles, and log-ratio profiles), we need to set a group of 'tolerances' to define the convergence test of the solvers. (Details can be found in the references.) We will set the tolerances as ``10^(-1:-1:-max_tol_order)``. Default is ``10``.

  - **max_eval_factor**: the factor multiplied to each problem's dimension to get the maximum number of evaluations for each problem. Default is ``500``.

  - **merit_fun**: the merit function to measure the quality of a point using the objective function value and the maximum constraint violation. It should be a function handle

      ``(fun_value, maxcv_value, maxcv_init) -> merit_value``,

    where ``fun_value`` is the objective function value, ``maxcv_value`` is the maximum constraint violation, and ``maxcv_init`` is the maximum constraint violation at the initial guess. The size of ``fun_values`` and ``maxcv_values`` is the same, and the size of ``maxcv_init`` is the same as the second to last dimensions of ``fun_values``. The default merit function ``varphi(x)`` is defined by the objective function ``f(x)`` and the maximum constraint violation ``v(x)`` as

    .. parsed-literal::

        **varphi**\(**x**) = **f**\(**x**),                      if **v**\(**x**) <= v1,
        **varphi**\(**x**) = **f**\(**x**) + 1e5 * (**v**\(**x**) - v1),  if v1 < **v**\(**x**) <= v2,
        **varphi**\(**x**) = Inf,                       if **v**\(**x**) > v2,

    where ``v1 = max(1e-5, v0)`` and ``v2 = min(0.01, 1e-10 * max(1, v0))``, and ``v0`` is the initial maximum constraint violation.

  - **project_x0**: whether to project the initial point to the feasible set. Default is ``false``.

  - **run_plain**: whether to run an extra experiment with the ``'plain'`` feature. Default is ``false``.

  - **score_only**: whether to only calculate the scores of the solvers without drawing the profiles and saving the data. Default is ``false``.

  - **summarize_performance_profiles**: whether to add all the performance profiles to the summary PDF. Default is ``true``.

  - **summarize_data_profiles**: whether to add all the data profiles to the summary PDF. Default is ``true``.

  - **summarize_log_ratio_profiles**: whether to add all the log-ratio profiles to the summary PDF. Default is ``false``.

  - **summarize_output_based_profiles**: whether to add all the output-based profiles of the selected profiles to the summary PDF. Default is ``true``.

  - **silent**: whether to show the information of the progress. Default is ``false``.

  - **solver_verbose**: the level of the verbosity of the solvers. ``0`` means no verbosity, ``1`` means some verbosity, and ``2`` means full verbosity. Default is ``1``.

  - **semilogx**: whether to use the semilogx scale during plotting profiles (performance profiles and data profiles). Default is ``true``.

  - **normalized_scores**: whether to normalize the scores of the solvers by the maximum score of the solvers. Default is ``false``.

  - **score_weight_fun**: the weight function to calculate the scores of the solvers in the performance and data profiles. It should be a function handle representing a nonnegative function in R^+. Default is ``1``.

  - **score_fun**: the scoring function to calculate the scores of the solvers. It should be a function handle

      ``profile_scores -> solver_scores``,

    where ``profile_scores`` is a 4D tensor containing scores for all profiles. The first dimension of ``profile_scores`` corresponds to the index of the solver, the second corresponds to the index of tolerance starting from 1, the third represents history-based or output-based profiles, and the fourth represents performance profiles, data profiles, or log-ratio profiles. The default scoring function takes the average of the history-based performance profiles under all the tolerances.

  - **line_colors**: the colors of the lines in the plots. It can be a cell array of short names of colors ``('r', 'g', 'b', 'c', 'm', 'y', 'k')`` or a matrix with each row being a RGB triplet. Default line colors are those in the palettename named "gem" (see MATLAB documentation for 'colororder'). Note that if the number of solvers is greater than the number of colors, we will cycle through the colors.

  - **line_styles**: the styles of the lines in the plots. It can be a cell array of chars that are the combinations of line styles ``('-', '-.', '--', ':')`` and markers ``('o', '+', '*', '.', 'x', 's', 'd', '^', 'v', '>', '<', 'p', 'h')``. Default line style order is ``{'-', '-.', '--', ':'}``. Note that if the number of solvers is greater than the number of line styles, we will cycle through the styles.

  - **line_widths**: the widths of the lines in the plots. It should be a positive scalar or a vector. Default is ``1.5``. Note that if the number of solvers is greater than the number of line widths, we will cycle through the widths.

  - **bar_colors**: two different colors for the bars of two solvers in the log-ratio profiles. It can be a cell array of short names of colors ``('r', 'g', 'b', 'c', 'm', 'y', 'k')`` or a 2-by-3 matrix with each row being a RGB triplet. Default is set to the first two colors in the ``line_colors`` option.
